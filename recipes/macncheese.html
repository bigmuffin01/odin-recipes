            This homemade mac and cheese recipe uses a classic mixture
             of sharp Cheddar and Parmesan. Cheddar is a fantastic base,
             while Parmesan adds a more complex and salty flavor. 
             Of course, you can adapt this recipe to suit your taste: 
             Gruyere, Monterey Jack, and Gouda are all great options for 
             macaroni and cheese.
